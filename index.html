      Welcome to the site of yet another weird developer. I make video games as <a href="/countryball-institution">long projects</a>, video games <a href="/french-fries">on a whim in two hours</a>, and web apps.
      <br><br>Anyways, what would you like to do here today?

          A few video games that I made on a whim or as longer projects. Mostly fun, save for 'French Fries'.

          These are some web apps I've made either by myself or with friends.
